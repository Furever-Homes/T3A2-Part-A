## User Stories

### Persona 1

**Who**: Pet Adopter  
**What**: Want to browse pets with images and information about each of them  
**Why**: To explore potential pets that fit in with my lifestyle and preferences

**REFINEMENT**: Initially lacked filtering options, but was refined to have a filtering option to ensure there wasn't an overwhelming number of pets being displayed

### Persona 2

**Who**: Pet Adopter  
**What**: Want to submit an adoption application  
**Why**: In order to express interest in a particular pet and give necessary details to the shelter

**REFINEMENT**: Applications include personalised questions such as experience, home environment, other pets to help admins make better decisions

### Persona 3

**Who**: Pet Adopter  
**What**: Want to save pets to a shortlist of favourites  
**Why**: To be able to revisit the pets I'm interested in and be able to consider how they can fit into my life before committing immediately

### Persona 4

**Who**: Shelter Admin
**What**: Need to review adoption applications for people looking to adopt pets
**Why**: To ensure we match pets with suitable homes, which are responsible and prepared to host

**REFINEMENT**: Sorting applications allocated to particular pets to compare applicants to ensure the pets are matched with the best suited home and no application is overlooked

### Persona 5

**Who**: Shelter Admin
**What**: Need to add new pets to the system
**Why**: To allow people to browse and apply for pets

**REFINEMENT**: Inclusion of images as well as descriptions that include breed and health details and availablity status. Pets now have the status (available, considering applicants, adopted) on their profiles.
